# Word SRS Extension

A simple Chrome extension designed for my own learning needs:  
- **Highlight to Save**: Select a word/phrase on any webpage and save it instantly.  
- **Built-in SRS Review**: Review saved words using a spaced repetition system (SRS).  
- **Minimal & Focused**: Unlike heavier tools such as Rememberry, this extension is intentionally simple, helping me learn faster without distraction.  

## Motivation
This project was created out of my own need to quickly collect new words while reading online and review them efficiently. Most existing tools felt too complex, so I built something straightforward and lightweight.
